# Jeopardy (Powered by React.js)
Hello welcome to my Jeopardy clone, made with `React.js`. This repository
was inspired by teachers wanting a fun way to do review with their
students.

# How to Run Jeopardy
You will need npm installed first, but after that you can
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
to start the server.

# Future Plans
Currently the questions are hard-coded into the application, which isn't
ideal, at all. I would like to add some UI/UX for people to create/edit
questions and save them locally to their machines.

# Contributing
Feel free to make issues or pull requests if you would like to make changes.
I'm currently in the process of adding the standard devops ci/cd infra to
this repository.
